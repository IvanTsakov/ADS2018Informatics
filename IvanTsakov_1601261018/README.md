## Hello there folks. My name is Ivan and I'll be posting some of my tasks for c# course. I'll mostly work with python. 

Alt-H2 How to run the solutions:
		To install python on Windows -> https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/
		To install python on Linux -> You have python installed but if you want to install better version or install it at all check this - https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/
		** For best experience I would recommend to run the solutions in the terminal by executing the program via following -> python "solution_name.py"**


### First solution will cover binary conversion to decimal and backwards.
